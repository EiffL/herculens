    The computation follows Eqs. (22)-(29) in Tessore & Metcalf (2015), where
    z = R * e^(i * phi) is a position vector in the lens plane,
    t = gamma - 1 is the logarithmic slope of the profile, and
    q is the axis ratio.

    This iterative implementation is necessary, since the usual hypergeometric
    function `hyp2f1` provided in `scipy.special` has not yet been implemented
    in an autodiff way in JAX.

    Note that the value returned includes an extra factor R multiplying Eq. (23)
    for omega(phi).
